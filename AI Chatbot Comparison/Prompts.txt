Make a web application that displays a random image from the internet in the very middle of the page. The image should randomize upon every refresh of the page.

Make a web application for managing invoices. The app should be able to store invoices that haven't been paid for yet. The app should make distinction between cyclically recurring payments and invoices that need to be paid for only once. The app should show reminders for the upcoming payments. The app should contain some example invoices with fictional data in both categories. The data of the invoices should be saved in the user's local storage in the browser and should persist between sessions. The user should be able to add their invoice information through the web view in an interactive form. The user should be able to click a button on an invoice to "pay" for the invoice and remove it from the list if it's a single payment invoice or advance the invoice into the next cycle if it's a recurring payment. The date of payment of the invoice should be formatted to be easily readable by a user, preferably in a DD-MM-YYYY format.
